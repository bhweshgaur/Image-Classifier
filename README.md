# Deep Learning 
## Project: Image Classifier
**Install**
This project requires **Python 3.x** and the following Python libraries installed:
- Numpy
- Json
- Matplotlib
- Tensorflow

You can run this project either on iPython Notebook or Colab Notebook. I recommend using Colab Notebook, because in iPython Notebook you might get error while loading dataset due to heavy traffic.

Either of the notebook require **%pip install tfds-nightly** command to run before loading data.
